    "Cavity cooling relies on spontaneous emission of an atom that is coupled to a field that has a certain energy mismatch. The atomic motion then compensates for the missing energy.\n",

    "$H = -\\Delta_c a^\\dagger a - \\Delta_a\\sigma^+\\sigma^- + \\eta(a + a^\\dagger) + g\\cos(x)(a^\\dagger \\sigma^- + a\\sigma^+),$\n",

The pump strength is $\\eta$, while the atom couples to the cavity with $g$ and the cavity has a mode function $\\cos(x)$. The atomic position $x$ is in units of the inverse cavity wave number. Note that this is a number rather than an operator since we treat the atomic motion classically.\n",
