    "# N-Particles in a double-well potential\n",
    "In this example we will first solve the problem of a single particle in a double well potential. We then will assume that the particle is always trapped in one of the low energy states. This allows us to reduce the Hilbert space of the system to these states only. Using this reduced Hilbert space we will investigate the case of N indistinguishable particles in such a system. Finally we will add particle-particle interaction to obtain a more interesting problem."
