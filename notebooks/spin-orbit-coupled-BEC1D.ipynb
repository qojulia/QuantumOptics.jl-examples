    "We see that in contrast to the non-interacting case both spin components exhibit a spatially periodic denstiy distribution and they are populated equally. This phase is called the \"stripe phase\" of a spin-orbit coupled BEC. In this phase the continuous symmetry of the Hamiltonian is spontaneously broken. This can be seen by running the simulation above several times. The position of the maxima of the density distribution for the two spin components are shifted randomly in space. Hence, the stripe phase of a spin-orbit coupled BEC fulfills all criteria to be called a \"supersolid\" (coherent BEC with an additionally broken continuous symmetry).\n",
