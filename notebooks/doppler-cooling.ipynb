    "In this example, we will treat a simple model of Doppler cooling and show how the recoil an atom experiences when spontaneously emitting a photon limits the temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep it simple, we will only consider one-dimensional, classical motion of a two-level atom coupled to a standing wave. The Hamiltonian of this system reads\n",
    "\n",
    "$ H = -\\hbar\\Delta\\sigma^+\\sigma^- + \\hbar\\Omega \\cos(kx)\\left(\\sigma^+ + \\sigma^-\\right). $\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\Delta = \\omega_\\ell - \\omega_\\mathrm{a}$ is the detuning between the standing wave of frequency $\\omega_\\ell$ and the atomic transition frequency $\\omega_\\mathrm{a}$. The standing wave has an amplitude $\\Omega$.\n",
    "The spontaneous emission of the atom occurs at a rate $\\gamma$ and is taken into account with\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\mathcal{L}[\\rho] = \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\left(2\\sigma^-\\rho\\sigma^+ - \\sigma^+\\sigma^-\\rho - \\rho\\sigma^+\\sigma^-\\right).$\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical equations of motion for the atomic positon $x$ and its momentum $p$ are given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\dot{x} = \\frac{p}{m}, $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\dot{p} = 2k\\Omega\\sin(kx)\\Re\\left\\{\\langle \\sigma^-\\rangle\\right\\}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to include the recoil. This is done via a classical \"jump\" in a semi-classical MCWF approach. Namely, if we consider quantum mechanical states of motion, the state of an atom in the excited state with a momentum $p_0$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$ |\\psi\\rangle = |e\\rangle\\otimes|p_0\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the collapse operator of a spontaneous emission event where the photon is emitted into the $x$-direction is $J = e^{ik\\hat{x}}\\sigma^-$, where $\\hat{x}$ is the position operator. Such a jump maps to the atomic internal state to the ground state as well as providing a shift in momentum when applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the momentum expectation value changes when a jump occurs,\n",
    "\n",
    "$p \\equiv \\langle\\psi| \\hat{p}|\\psi \\rangle =  p_0 ~\\to~  \\langle\\psi|J^\\dagger  \\hat{p}J|\\psi\\rangle = \\langle p | e^{-ikx}\\hat{p}e^{ikx}|p \\rangle = p_0 + \\hbar k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last step, we used the relation $e^{-ikx}\\hat{p}e^{ikx}= \\hat{p} + \\hbar k$ (the position operator is the generator of momentum translation), which can be shown using the canonical commutator $[\\hat{x},\\hat{p}]=i\\hbar$ and the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, in order to treat the recoil, a Monte-Carlo jump from the excited to the ground state needs to affect the classical momentum variable as well. Let us stress here, that the above relation holds only for spontaneous emission in the $x$-direction. We will later see how the different directions are taken into account."

    "In order to include the momentum kicks the atom experiences when spontaneously emitting a photon, we switch to using the MCWF method. To this end, we need to define a jump function which tells the solver how it should act on the classical part of the system whenever a jump with the jump operator `J[i]` occurs. In our case there is only one jump operator, and we need to modify the momentum which we store in `u[2]`. For simplicity, we assume that the atom is equally likely to emit a photon in all directions. The momentum kick in 3D is therefore a random vector normalized to the length `k`. Still we only consider 1D motion, which is why we only pick one component of this random vector and add it to the momentum whenever a jump occurs.\n",
